    "I am a Manufacturing Engineer for New Product Introduction at Intuitive Surgical, a medical device company that assists surgeons in conducting minimally invasive procedures that lead to quicker patient recovery times. For me, one of the most impactful things about EWB was the focus on putting the community first - people first. I am beyond excited to have translated this mission to my career, and look forward to carrying the EWB mindset to my work at the cutting edge of medical devices."
