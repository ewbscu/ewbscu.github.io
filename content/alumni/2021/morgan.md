    "I am currently working in Reno, NV at GuidedChoice Investment Advice. I've been developing our app and website for the past 6 months. My time in EWB helped develop many of my professional skills. For starters, the first role I ever took in EWB was the Webmaster. This allowed me to get familiar with website development, which is a bulk of my daily tasks. I also got to improve my leadership skills by leading our Education ministry, which has already helped me move up within my company and lead major projects even though I'm the newest person here. Lastly, EWB taught me how to embrace and tackle tasks that are outside of my comfort zone. In EWB, I often was not faced with tasks that lined up with my major (Computer Engineering). Being comfortable with the unknown has allowed me to tackle huge tasks at my job that once seemed impossible."
