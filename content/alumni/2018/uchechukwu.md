quote: >
    "I am currently a Mechanical Engineering Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University and I research how different lattice structures can be applied to aerospace components. Working with EWB at SCU was so important to my growth as engineer. Not only did it give me the opportunity to aid in creating devices to better aid a community and improve my finite element skills (FEA), but also develop a better understanding of what it means to be an engineer with and for others. I know that this experience will continue to guide me in all the engineering related work I do and I hope to continue working on engineering projects that positively serve communities."
