position: Class of 2016
quote: >
    "I am working as a Data Scientist in Berlin. I still carry with me many of the lessons learned from EWB, like being open to improvising solutions when resources are constrained, staying approachable when working with different kinds of people and cultures, and starting any design process with empathizing with the end user. The largest impact however, has been that seeing that my work, even at a young age, can have a significant and measurable positive impact on other people's lives is an incredible motivating force, even in the seemingly different work I do today."
