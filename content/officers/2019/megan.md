    "Innovative humanitarian engineering was the reason I became a Civil at Santa Clara, but Engineers Without Borders is the reason I truly fell in love with it. This community provides real, invaluable experience, results, and fulfillment to both our members and partner community in Rwanda. Self-executed and directed by students, EWB is a testament to our future leaders positively changing our world today."
