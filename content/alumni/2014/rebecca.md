quote: >
    "I am currently a PhD candidate at UC Davis, and I am conducting my research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. I specialize in computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer, currently working on research related to the efficiency of nuclear energy. EWB was a building block in my love of engineering and helping others. Working with EWB allowed me the opportunity to work on a project with a common goal of helping a community through listening, innovating, and communicating. The experience has encouraged me to listen to the true issues at hand and communicate in technical and non-technical manners."
