    "I am a junior studying civil engineering. I joined EWB to learn more about human-centered design and get to know other students. EWB has been a great opportunity to learn how to effectively communicate and work on real-life engineering projects as a student. It was been very exciting to work on projects that directly relate to the courses I am taking within my major."
