    "I am currently working for Specialized Bicycle Components in Morgan Hill California as a Composites Development Engineer. I work with suppliers all over the world to bring carbon bicycle parts to production. For me EWB was never about the personal experience or executing on a specific task, it was about the energy you can build in a communities around the world showing them what they are personally capable of. EWB has drastically impacted the way I work professionally, how I approach various ethical questions we encounter, how to approach people form diverse backgrounds, and most of all how to organize a team to effectively execute on a common goal."
