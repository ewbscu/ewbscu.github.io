position: Class of 2017
quote: >
    "I'm working as an analyst at Arup in San Francisco. I enjoy modeling hazards like earthquakes and floods so that, through understanding their impacts, we can build more resilient structures and communities. EWB cultivated in me a sense of responsibility and love for this planet and its people, which has continued to motivate me in my personal and professional life. The people-driven projects of EWB taught me powerful lessons about the importance of communication in engineering. I'm still inspired by the experiences I had and the people I met through EWB."
