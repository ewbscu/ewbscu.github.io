    "Since graduating, I have been working in protein engineering for a company called Sutro Biopharma that is developing cancer therapeutics. EWB taught me invaluable skills about engineering problem solving, working and communicating well with others, and human centered design that I use every day. I really think EWB-SCU provides a unique experience and opportunity for Santa Clara undergrads, and I couldn't be more grateful for everything I learned during my time in the club."
