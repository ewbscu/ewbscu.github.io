    "I’m a Manufacturing Engineer for the Stapling Team at Intuitive Surgical working on sustaining and improving the processes of our current Reload products. EWB taught me that empathy is one of the greatest qualities an engineer, or anyone, can have, and that if you don’t design with the needs of the consumer at the forefront, you’re bound to miss the mark. This was something I could not have picked up in classes alone, and to build on this with learning how to manage team projects for a common goal made EWB one the greatest challenges I took on at SCU. Making an impact on the health and wellness of others has always been a goal of mine, and I’m beyond happy that I could find that in EWB as well as my career."
