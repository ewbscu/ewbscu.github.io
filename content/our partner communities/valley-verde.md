# About Valley Verde

Valley Verde was started by Raul Lozano, the founder and executive director. His family immigrated to Mountain View in 1963 with a garden in the backyard growing fresh vegetables to fuel the family. When the 2007 financial crisis hit, many people were impacted and as as result, a lot of people were seeking for help from Food Banks. The founder Raul Lozano wanted to help so he started a program to teach people about organic farming.

Valley Verde noticed an opportunity to impact the community through their Community Food System (non-profit 501(3)(c) organization). The South Bay Area is comprised of a large population of “working underprivileged,” 92% are immigrants of Latino and Asian origin. While Santa Clara County’s median income is one of the highest in the nation, there is a continually growing income gap.

Valley Verde offers food access, micro-entrepreneurship, and community greenhouse programs year-round in order to create a lasting impact on food security, environmental conservation and access to green space for families in the San Jose Area.
