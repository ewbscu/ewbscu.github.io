    We apply technical knowledge to solve pressing challenges in developing nations, 
    while providing SCU students with real project experience.
  description: >
    With an active long-term project in Nyange, Rwanda, students experience the entire project process â€” 
    from identifying a problem to ideating solutions to implementing the final product. 
    Throughout the academic year, students communicate with the partner community to address their needs, 
    design and prototype solutions, and iterate and test designs. These projects, though entirely student run, 
    are held to the EWB National model and on-campus faculty reviews. This ensures project sustainability, 
    and reinforces the importance of thorough design practices.
