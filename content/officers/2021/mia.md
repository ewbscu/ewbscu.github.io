    "I am a third year studying bioengineering on the medical devices track. I joined EWB so that I could practice the engineering skills I was learning in class in a meaningful way with a group of likeminded individuals. Because of my involvement with EWB, I have found a community of engineers and have found clarity in my chosen career direction."
