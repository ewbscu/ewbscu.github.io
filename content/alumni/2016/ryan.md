quote: >
    "I’m an account manager for Siltronic, a silicon wafer manufacturer. EWB had a major impact on my career trajectory. It gave me confidence to tackle new challenges, solve problems on the fly, and work with people I’ve never met towards a common goal. It also taught me valuable lessons in leadership and humility. I’ll never forget watching the community in Nyange put together our first iteration of the tile press. The joy on their faces as they worked together to assemble the press was nothing short of inspirational. Then, shortly after, when the tile press wasn’t working as planned, the ability of our team to come together, nail down the root cause of the problem, and create a plan to fix the immediate problem is something that I’ll always remember. Working with people who have real life threatening problems, helped give me perspective and remain calm when problems in my day to day life arise."
