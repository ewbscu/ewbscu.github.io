quote: >
    "I'm currently working as a project planner for Walt Disney Imagineering. EWB provided me the opportunity to get hands on practice with frugal design and machining, travel with the team to Rwanda, and understand the remarkable impact that culture has on the use of a product. The people I met in our community had the greatest effect on my appreciation for Engineers Without Borders. In my work today, I embrace the reminder that the people on the other end of the experience are the primary reason why deliver each new product."
