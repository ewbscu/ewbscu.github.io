position: Class of 2018
quote: >
    "I am currently a research technician at a Stanford neuroscience lab under Dr. Nirao Shah. I will start my PhD (likely in neuroscience) within the next 2 years. EWB has given me the opportunity to experience, understand, and apply SCU's motto of ""engineering with a mission"". Traveling to Rwanda in 2016 gave me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to understand and appreciate the needs of the community while learning about the culture and history of the country. While EWB has not yet made a tangible impact on my career choice, the club has taught me valuable lessons on people-centric engineering that I will forever carry forward."
