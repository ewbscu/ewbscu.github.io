    "I am working as a Mechanical Designer at Zoox, a self-driving car company that is re-inventing transportation for big cities. Because the vehicle is designed from the ground up to be autonomous, the company's success relies on people who come together every day to push the limits of automotive design, robotics, AI, and manufacturing. EWB was instrumental in preparing me for this cross-functional environment because it was also a diverse team working towards the shared goal of using engineering to positively impact other people's lives."
