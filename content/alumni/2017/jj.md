position: Class of 2017
quote: >
    "I currently work at ACCO Engineered Systems, a mechanical contractor, out of San Francisco. I design and manage HVAC and refrigeration projects across the Bay Area. My experience with EWB taught me how to actively listen to and assess someones problems, then deliver a project that meets the customers needs. I also developed the skills to search for the root of problems and to find long term solutions instead of surface level repairs. I consistently use the same project evaluation process that I learned from the Rwanda projects in my current position."
