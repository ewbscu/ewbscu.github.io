position: Class of 2019
quote: >
    "I'm currently a Mechanical Engineer at Auris Health Inc., a surgical robotics company in Redwood City, working on mechanism, actuator, and structures design for the Advanced Development capital equipment systems team. My experience with EWB stimulated my goal to ""engineer with a mission"" and motivated my interest in the medical device industry. Hands-on experience doing CAD and component selection have proven valuable in day-to-day work, but most importantly, the friendships established through EWB will prove vital connections as I continue to navigate my career."
