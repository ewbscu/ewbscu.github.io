After designing the cart during the school year and the long hours put in during the evenings after work we were finally able to get our electric wagon on the trail to test it. Overall it went very well! The cart trekked up hill very easily, it was actually harder to go down hill! We learned that the front wheels need some adjustments to endure the loads. We made a video!
