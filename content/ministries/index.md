# Engineering Ministry

The Engineering Ministry is geared towards understanding the needs of our partnered community, brainstorming ways to support them, and designing and implementing solutions. We do work that requires many people with all different levels of understanding of engineering concepts. We look to bring problem solvers, critical thinkers, and hard workers together to learn more about improving our global village through engineering solutions.

# Education Ministry

The Education Ministry is in charge of “bridging the gap” between the rest of the EWB team and our partner community in Rwanda by fostering communication and understanding between the two groups. We achieve these goals through the use of presentations and other educational tools that are intended to spark conversation at EWB general meetings, as well as ensuring that all materials sent to the CO-OP in Rwanda are easily understood despite cultural differences.

# Public Relations Ministry

The Public Relations ministry focuses on the growth of our EWB team. We facilitate yearly fundraising events, including our Virtual 5K for $5K, Mother’s Day Rose Sale, and Succulent Sale, that allow our team to travel to our CO-OP in Rwanda every summer. We develop our EWB team by encouraging passionate students to participate in EWB at involvement fairs as well as connect EWB alumni to current members. Letting people know who we are, what we do, and how they can contribute is what we strive to do.
