    "I am doing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley, with an emphasis in Biomechanics. I’m excited to combine my SCU bioengineering degree with more conventional engineering principles to better understand the human body and I’m looking forward to becoming an interdisciplinary engineer. EWB definitely played a large part in my decision to study mechanical engineering, as my project work exposed me to mechanical design when my classroom studies at SCU did not."
