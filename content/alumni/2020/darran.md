    "“EWB was a great springboard for me to practice real world problem solving and learn what it means to be an engineer beyond what's taught in the classroom. I am thankful for having been able to grow as an engineer and a problem solver around like-minded individuals who also sought to better themselves while helping others. The lessons I learned from EWB are invaluable and I am grateful for the opportunities the chapter presented to me. Currently, I am working as an HVAC & Plumbing Mechanical Engineer at AGC Inc. while pursuing my Master’s Degree in Engineering Management from SCU.”"
