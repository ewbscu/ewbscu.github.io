    "I'm currently working as a UX/Product Designer at Vectra AI, a cybersecurity startup in San Jose. Although my role is not related to my major at SCU (mechanical engineering), my experience with EWB gave me a unique perspective on problem solving that helps me in my day to day workflow. I also owe EWB for helping me cultivate my communication and interpersonal skills."
