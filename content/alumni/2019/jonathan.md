quote: >
    I am an NPI Manufacturing Engineer at Intuitive Surgical working to improve the production of robotic-assisted surgical instruments. My involvement in EWB was pivotal to my engineering education and career; working to improve our community's tile making cooperative showed me the importance of designing with empathy. Improving processes for our community and seeing first hand how my engineering work could improve lives is largely why I decided to go into medical device manufacturing.
